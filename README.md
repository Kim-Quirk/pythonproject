# Overview

This project was focused on becoming more familiar with the Python coding language. I explored downloading and using various libraries and creating an interactive windowed game experience.

I created a basic hangman game. The game reads from a list of words and generates the basic game. The user then has to guess a letter at a time and the game will check whether or not the word contains that letter. The game also keeps track of lives, guesses, and whether or not the game has ended.

With this software, I was trying to better familiarize myself with the Python language. I was also reviewing how classes work in general since it has been a while.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code

I used the Python programming language with the PyQt5 and random libraries.

# Future Work

Things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.

* Add a restart game functionality
* Make the game scalable to the screen size
* Improve user input (only accept letters)
* Separate code into more readable files
