# Overview

This project was focused on becoming more familiar with the Python coding language. I explored downloading and using various libraries and creating an interactie windowed game experience.

I created a basic hangman game. The game reads from a list of words and generates the basic game. The user then has to guess a letter at a time and the game will check whether or not the word contains that letter. The game also keeps track of lives, guesses, and whether or not the game has ended.

With this software, I was trying to better familiarize myself witht the Python language. I was also reviewing how classes work in general since it has been a while.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

VSCode

I used the Python programming languge with the PyQt5 and random libraries.

# Future Work

Things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.

* Add a restart game funcitonality
* Make the game scalable to the screen size
* Improve user input (only accept letters)
* Seperate code into more readable files
